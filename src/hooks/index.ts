/**
 * Hooks Directory - Custom React Hooks
 * 
 * This directory contains custom React hooks for component-level logic.
 * These hooks encapsulate stateful logic that can be shared across components.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Export all custom hooks for easy importing
 * - Provide reusable stateful logic patterns
 * - Handle common component interactions
 * - Manage local storage, API calls, and form state
 * - Abstract complex logic into simple hook interfaces
